# Claude Code Rule Document for LTD Shadcn Storybook UI

Project Rule Document – `storybook-shadcn-lab`

## 1. Project Goal

- Build and maintain a **Next.js 16** + **Tailwind CSS 4.x** app that uses **shadcn/ui (CLI 3.x)** and **Storybook 10 (Next.js + Vite framework)** to:
  - Display and edit shadcn components in isolation via Storybook stories.
  - Keep component stories consistent with the live app environment (providers, theming, Tailwind, routing).

All work Claude Code performs in this repository must directly support this goal.

---

## 2. Version & Tooling Requirements (Hard Constraints)

Claude Code must **always** assume and enforce these versions/configs unless explicitly updated by the human:

- **Next.js**
  - Use **Next.js 16.1+** (app router, `app/` directory).
  - Use official Next.js 16 upgrade/docs when in doubt.
- **Storybook**
  - Use **Storybook 10+** with the `@storybook/nextjs-vite` framework (Next.js + Vite).
  - Do **not** configure legacy `@storybook/nextjs` (webpack) unless the human explicitly asks for Webpack.
- **shadcn/ui**
  - Use the **new shadcn CLI**: `npx shadcn@latest` with `init` and `add` commands.
  - Do **not** use deprecated `shadcn-ui` npm packages or older CLI syntax.
- **Tailwind CSS**
  - Use **Tailwind CSS 4.x** with the official Next.js integration guide for configuration.
  - Ensure `globals.css` (or the unified Tailwind entry file) is imported **both** in:
    - `app/layout.tsx` (application)
    - `.storybook/preview` (Storybook)
- **Node / Runtime**
  - Assume **Node.js 18+** is available at all times.

If any template, blog post, or example suggests older versions (Next.js 13–15, Storybook 7, old shadcn CLI, Tailwind 3), Claude Code must treat those as **outdated** and adapt them to the versions above.

## 3. Source-of-Truth Docs (When Claude Code Looks Things Up)

When it needs documentation or examples, Claude Code should prioritize **these sources in this order**:

1. **Next.js 16**
   - Official docs and upgrade guide for Next 16.
2. **Storybook 10 + Next.js + Vite**
   - Storybook Next.js Vite framework docs.
3. **shadcn/ui CLI 3.x**
   - shadcn CLI / changelog and CLI docs (init/add, new registry behavior).
4. **Tailwind CSS with Next.js**
   - Tailwind official Next.js installation guide (latest).

If Claude Code encounters conflicting instructions between a blog and these official docs, it must follow the **official docs** above.

---

## 4. Behavioral Rules for Claude Code

### 4.1 Project Scope Discipline

Claude Code must:

- Only create or modify files that:
  - Configure Next.js 16, Tailwind 4.x, shadcn/ui, or Storybook 10.
  - Add, update, or organize Storybook stories for shadcn components.
  - Support theming, providers, or documentation related to the above.
- Avoid:
  - Building unrelated features (APIs, dashboards, auth systems, etc.) unless explicitly requested.
  - Migrating to new frameworks or experimental packages without explicit human approval.

If unsure whether a change is in scope, Claude Code must **ask for clarification** before proceeding.

### 4.2 Storybook Rules

- Always use:
  - Storybook **CSF3** format for stories.
  - `tags: ['autodocs']` in meta for documented components.
  - The **Next.js + Vite** framework configuration.
- All stories for shadcn components must:
  - Live in `stories/**/*.stories.tsx`.
  - Include **3–5 variants** per component demonstrating realistic states (default, disabled, error, loading, etc.).
  - Use the same theming/providers and Tailwind styling as the Next.js app.

### 4.3 shadcn/ui Rules

- Component operations must use:
  - `npx shadcn@latest init` for initial setup.
  - `npx shadcn@latest add <component>` for components.
- Install components into `components/ui/` using **shadcn defaults** unless otherwise specified.

If shadcn CLI suggests config changes (Tailwind/theme adjustments), Claude Code should prefer the CLI's recommended changes when they remain compatible with Tailwind 4 and Next.js 16.

---

## 5. Workflow & Commit Checkpoints

Claude Code should follow a **short-burst, checkpoint-oriented workflow**:

1. **Core Setup Phase**
   - Create/maintain Next.js 16 + Tailwind 4.x base app.
   - Initialize shadcn/ui CLI and verify it runs.
2. **Storybook Integration Phase**
   - Add Storybook 10 with `@storybook/nextjs-vite`.
   - Import `globals.css` in Storybook preview and wire providers.
3. **Components & Stories Phase**
   - Install shadcn components via CLI.
   - Build stories in `stories/` using CSF3 + autodocs.
4. **Theming & Verification Phase**
   - Configure global theme and (optional) theme toggle (e.g., via `@storybook/addon-themes` or current recommended addon).
   - Run `npm run storybook`, verify all components render and autodocs generate.

After each major phase, Claude Code should:

- Present a concise summary of:
  - Files changed.
  - Any commands to re-run.
- Then **pause** for a human to review and optionally commit before continuing.

## 6. Safety & Consistency Rules

- Do **not** downgrade or remove:
  - Next.js 16.x.
  - Storybook 10.x.
  - Tailwind 4.x.
  - shadcn CLI 3.x behavior.
- When copying examples from older docs:
  - Update imports, config options, and file locations to match:
    - Next.js 16 app router conventions.
    - Storybook 10 + Vite framework config.
    - shadcn CLI `init` / `add` commands.
- If a choice is required and not specified:
  - Prefer **shadcn defaults** for components, styles, and theme structure.
  - Prefer the most recent **official documentation** listed in Section 3.
